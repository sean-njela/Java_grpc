# User Management System 🌟

Welcome to the **User Management System** 🎉, where you can manage users in a simple, efficient, and distributed way using **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** technology! 🚀

This project allows you to add, delete, retrieve, update, and list users, as well as remotely shut down the server. It’s all designed to give you a seamless experience with object-oriented programming and client-server architecture. 🤖

## 💡 Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a **distributed user database** where users are represented by **objects** that store essential details such as:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Birthdate
- Salary
- Gender (enum)
- Division
- Position

The server manages these user objects and supports remote operations through RMI, while the client can interact with the server to perform CRUD operations. 🖥️📡

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Scalability**: The system is designed for easy expansion. You can add more features like user authentication, role management, or advanced querying.
- **Reliability**: With the retry mechanism in place for client-server communication, the system handles temporary server downtimes and ensures smooth operation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The command-line interface (CLI) is intuitive, with clear instructions and prompts for each action.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add User** 🆕: Add a new user with all their details.
- **Delete User** 🗑️: Remove a user from the system.
- **Retrieve User** 🔍: Fetch details of a specific user.
- **List Users** 📋: Display all users currently stored in the system.
- **Update User** ✏️: Modify the details of an existing user.
- **Remote Shutdown** 🔴: Shutdown the server remotely (like turning off the lights! 🌙).
- **Connection Retry Mechanism** 🔄: If the server is down, the client will try reconnecting multiple times before giving up. 🛠️

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Java 🖥️
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **RMI** (Remote Method Invocation) for client-server communication.
  - **Serializable** for object transmission over the network.
  - **Server Shutdown** via system exit commands.
- **Dependencies**: Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later)
- **Version Control**: Git (you can contribute and track changes via GitHub)
- **Data Storage**: Users are stored in memory and are lost when the server is restarted. (You can modify this to include a persistent database like MySQL, MongoDB, or a file-based solution)

## 📦 How to Run

### 1. Start the Server 🚀

- Compile and run the `MyRMI.java` class to start the RMI registry and bind the `Hello` object to a name.

  ```bash
  javac MyRMI.java
  java MyRMI
  ```

  The server will be up and running, ready to accept requests. The system will listen on port **5001** for incoming connections.

### 2. Run the Client 🖥️

- Compile and run the `HelloClient.java` class to interact with the server.

  ```bash
  javac HelloClient.java
  java HelloClient
  ```

  Once the client is running, you will be prompted to enter different actions, such as adding a new user, retrieving user details, or shutting down the server.

  **Client Options**:

  - Add a user
  - Delete a user
  - Modify user details
  - List all users
  - Retrieve user details
  - Shutdown the server

  **Example**:

  - When adding a user, you will be prompted to input information such as **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Salary**, and other details.

  After interacting with the system, you can shut it down remotely with the **Shutdown Server** option. ✨

### 3. Remote Shutdown ⚡

The server allows remote shutdown by the client. Once you are done using the system, the client can issue a shutdown command which will safely terminate the server and stop the RMI service.
